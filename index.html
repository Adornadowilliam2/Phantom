          <h3>Former Member#4 of Phantom Troupe</h3>
          <p>
            As for Hisoka's desire to fight the leader of the Phantom Troupe,
            Chrollo Lucilfer, it stems from his fascination with Chrollo's
            abilities and intellect. Chrollo is widely regarded as one of the
            most formidable characters in the series, possessing a unique skill
            set known as "Skill Hunter." This ability allows Chrollo to steal
            and utilize other people's abilities, making him an incredibly
            versatile and dangerous opponent. Hisoka's desire to fight Chrollo
            can be seen as a manifestation of his obsession with strong
            opponents. Chrollo represents the pinnacle of strength and skill in
            Hisoka's eyes, and defeating him would be the ultimate test of his
            own abilities. Hisoka is drawn to the challenge that Chrollo
            presents and sees their potential battle as the ultimate climax to
            his personal journey.
