            Hisoka's desire to fight Chrollo Lucilfer, leader of the Phantom

            dangerous adversary. Hisoka sees Chrollo as the pinnacle of strength
            and skill, viewing a potential battle as the ultimate test of his
            abilities and the climax of his personal journey.
