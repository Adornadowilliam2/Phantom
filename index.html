              As for Hisoka's desire to fight the leader of the Phantom Troupe,
              Chrollo Lucilfer, it stems from his fascination with Chrollo's
              abilities and intellect. Chrollo is widely regarded as one of the
              most formidable characters in the series, possessing a unique
              skill set known as "Skill Hunter." This ability allows Chrollo to
              steal and utilize other people's abilities, making him an
              incredibly versatile and dangerous opponent.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hisoka's desire to fight Chrollo can be seen as a manifestation of
              his obsession with strong opponents. Chrollo represents the
              pinnacle of strength and skill in Hisoka's eyes, and defeating him
              would be the ultimate test of his own abilities. Hisoka is drawn
              to the challenge that Chrollo presents and sees their potential
              battle as the ultimate climax to his personal journey.
